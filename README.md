# palindromia

This is a Palindrome words detector. 
I made for my learning and fun. I was trying to apply Controller View Model architecture pattern

1. Open the application

2. Just type a word in the textfield and press enter or click the button to check if that word is a palindrome word

3. If the word you typed is a palindrome, you'll see 2 message telling you 'Es Palíndromo' and showing you the inverted String without
spaces

4. If you type a complete number string, you'll see a message telling you 'es numérico', it means that you just typed numbers, but
if you mix numbers and characters this message doesn't show -i need to work on that validation-.

5. If you click on X label to close, you'll be asked if you really want to close the program.
